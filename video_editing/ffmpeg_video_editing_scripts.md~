# Ffmpeg Video editing scripts

Some general information about ffmpeg:

`ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex "[0:v]setpts=PTS/(TIMELAPSE_FACTOR)[v];[v]crop=W:H:X:Y" -an output.mkv`

- input.mkv can be mp4
- TIMELAPSE_FACTOR needs to be replaced with an integer, like 4, which would mean 4x as fast.
- W:H:X:Y are crop parameters (Width, Height, X-coordinate, Y-coordinate)
- The `-an` flag omits audio.
